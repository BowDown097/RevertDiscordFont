### How do I use this?
Get a client mod with theming support (Vencord is the one I use) and throw in the font.css file. Alternatively, you can use the RevertDiscordFont.theme.css file which provides theme info for clients like BetterDiscord.

### Why should I use this theme? There's probably already like 5
Well, mine is better, simply put. You don't have to install any font and I've accounted for the many changes they did to font sizing and weight, which no other theme I've seen does.
