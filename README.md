# RevertDiscordFont
Revert Discord's font change.

### How do I use this?
Get a client mod with theming support (Vencord is the one I use) and throw in the font.css file.

### Why should I use this theme? There's probably already like 5
Well, mine is better, simply put. You don't have to install any font and I've accounted for the many changes they did to font sizing and weight, which no other theme I've seen does.
